Riddemon's Rebalance - Assimilate Bio-Trophies

===DESCRIPTION===

[h1] Overview [/h1]
Tired of having so many different species to pamper? Now you can assimilate any of you bio-trophies into your original bio-trophy species via mandatory gene-therapy.

[h1] Changes [/h1]
[list]
  [*] Adds the [b]Mandatory Gene-Therapy[/b] living standard.
  [list]
    [*] Available after researching [b]Gene Tailoring[/b].
    [*] Bio-Trophies with this living standard will slowly be converted into your main species.

[h1] Updates [/h1]
This mod was originally meant for [b]personal use[/b], therefore updates are not guaranteed and the mod may change a lot between versions.

[h1] Balance [/h1]
The mod is balanced [b]following my standards[/b].
I am sorry if it does not follow yours (or someone else's) but there will be no effort to balance further than my own needs and opinions.
